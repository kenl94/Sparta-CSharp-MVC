# C# Project - Shopping Basket
## Task
We were aiming to create a shopping site using C# and Visual Studio where the user is able to browse and select products from a database and add them to a basket.

The user also needed to be able to view their basket and the total cost of their basket.

Each product needed to have a name, price, image and a category. The category for each product was defined by implementing nested routes.

## Purpose
The purpose of this task was to develop our C# and Visual Studio skills.
